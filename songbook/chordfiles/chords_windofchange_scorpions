Wind of Change - Scorpions

Intro:
C Dm C Dm Am G


Verse 1:
C                 Dm
  I follow the Moskva
              C
Down to Gorky Park
                 Dm      Am    G
Listening to the wind of change

C                  Dm
  An August summer night
                 C
Soldiers passing by
                 Dm      Am    G
Listening to the wind of change

C                      Dm
  The world is closing in
             C
Did you ever think
                    Dm          Am      G
That we could be so close, like brothers

C                     Dm
  The future's in the air
                   C
I can feel it everywhere
                 Dm      Am    G
Blowing with the wind of change


Refrain (ver. 'dream away'):
C    G         Dm           G
Take me to the magic of the moment
     C     G
On a glory night
          Dm            G             Am
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
F                G
  In the wind of change


Verse 2:
C                  Dm
  Walking down the street
            C
Distant memories
                  Dm      Am  G
Are buried in the past forever

C                 Dm
  I follow the Moskva
              C
Down to Gorky Park
                 Dm      Am    G
Listening to the wind of change


Refrain (ver. 'share dreams'):
C    G         Dm           G
Take me to the magic of the moment
     C     G
On a glory night
          Dm            G                  Am
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
F              G
  With you and me


Refrain (ver. 'dream away') 1x


Bridge:
Am                          G
   The wind of change blows straight
                 Am
Into the face of time
                           G
Like a stormwind that will ring
                              Am
The freedom bell for peace of mind
                   G
Let your balalaika sing
                        Em  E7
What my guitar wants to say


Refrain (ver. 'share dreams') 1x
