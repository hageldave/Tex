  abstract  = {Recent approaches for variational motion estimation typically either rely on first or second order regularisation strategies. While first order strategies are more appropriate for scenes with fronto-parallel motion, second order constraints are superior if it comes to the estimation of affine flow fields. Since using the wrong regularisation order may lead to a significant deterioration of the results, it is surprising that there has not been much effort in the literature so far to determine this order automatically. In our work, we address the aforementioned problem in two ways. (i) First, we discuss two anisotropic smoothness terms of first and second order, respectively, that share important structural properties and that are thus particularly suited for being combined within an order-adaptive variational framework. (ii) Secondly, based on these two smoothness terms, we develop four different variational methods and with it four different strategies for adaptively selecting the regularisation order: a global and a local strategy based on half-quadratic regularisation, a non-local approach that relies on neighbourhood information, and a region based method using level sets. Experiments on recent benchmarks show the benefits of each of the strategies. Moreover, they demonstrate that adaptively combining different regularisation orders not only allows to outperform single-order strategies but also to obtain advantages beyond the ones of a frame-wise selection.},

abstract="Most variational optic flow approaches just consist of three constituents: a data term, a smoothness term and a smoothness weight. In this paper, we present an approach that harmonises these three components. We start by developing an advanced data term that is robust under outliers and varying illumination conditions. This is achieved by using constraint normalisation, and an HSV colour representation with higher order constancy assumptions and a separate robust penalisation. Our novel anisotropic smoothness is designed to work complementary to the data term. To this end, it incorporates directional information from the data constraints to enable a filling-in of information solely in the direction where the data term gives no information, yielding an optimal complementary smoothing behaviour. This strategy is applied in the spatial as well as in the spatio-temporal domain. Finally, we propose a simple method for automatically determining the optimal smoothness weight. This method bases on a novel concept that we call ``optimal prediction principle'' (OPP). It states that the flow field obtained with the optimal smoothness weight allows for the best prediction of the next frames in the image sequence. The benefits of our ``optic flow in harmony'' (OFH) approach are demonstrated by an extensive experimental validation and by a competitive performance at the widely used Middlebury optic flow benchmark.",

abstract="On the one hand, anisotropic diffusion is a well-established concept that has improved numerous computer vision approaches by permitting direction-dependent smoothing. On the other hand, recent applications have uncovered the importance of second order regularisation. The goal of this work is to combine the benefits of both worlds. To this end, we propose a second order regulariser that allows to penalise both jumps and kinks in a direction-dependent way. We start with an isotropic coupling model, and systematically introduce anisotropic concepts from first order approaches. We demonstrate the benefits of our model by experiments, and apply it to improve an existing focus fusion method.",
